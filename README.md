# Ritual Noise
The lyrics from Covenant's 'Ritual Noise' rendered in Cypher.

## Usage

Run the Cypher in `load.cyp` which should return the graph in all its glory. Then run `query.cyp` and the lyrics should just drop right out.

## About

This was thrown together for a talk on graph modelling at the London Neo4j User Group. It's deliberately a brute force attempt to get the lyrics in as a way of demonstrating that if you're modelling from semantics you can't just leap in from the words of the domain. I feel the query could be optimised though.

## Copyright

The lyrics remain copyright Covenant and are portrayed here under fair use.
